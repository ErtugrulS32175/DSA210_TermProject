# DSA210_TermProject

### **Project Aim**



As a university student, after lots of exam period, I have realized some significant changes in my life when exam dates are coming.Therefore; I want to look deeper to these changes 
This project aims to analyze the correlation between sleep patterns, eating habits,study hour and exam dates. By collecting my personal data, I will try to answer questions below:


- **How sleep duration affects study performance?**


- **When getting closer to the exam date, how sleeping hour and eating habbits vary?**


- **Is there any significant correlation between sleeping hour and studying hour?** 


- **Is there any significant correlation between eating habbit and studying hour?** 


- **How fast studying hour and coffee intake change while reaching to the exam date?** 


- **Which exam date made the most significant change in terms of habbits and studying hour?**
